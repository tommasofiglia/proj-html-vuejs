Step by step project.

Project name: proj-html-vuejs (MaxCoach site reproduction).

1) BASIC STRUCTURE CREATION IN HTML AND INSERTION OF CLASSES AND IDS FOR THE USE OF CSS.

- I will create the basic website structure in html paying attention to semantic tags like header, nav, main, section, footer.
- I will insert ids and classes where they are needed to simplify the use of CSS.

2) INSERTION OF THE CSS. WORKING ON THE WEBSITE'S AESTHETICS.

- I will start work on css in order to make website identical to original using property like display, margin, padding, position.

3) INSERTION OF JS. USE OF VUEJS TO CREATE ELEMENTS TO ADD IN HTML.

- I will create arrays of objects to insert elements in html using v-for.
- I will use them in some sections like navbar (for navbar links) and footer (again for the links).

4) WORK ON WEBSITE'S RESPONSIVITY. USE OF MEDIAQUERYS.

- I will use mediaquery on css-code to make website's responsivity.
